# Violentproxy

[![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/Violentproxy/Violentproxy.svg)](https://david-dm.org/Violentproxy/Violentproxy)

Named after [Violentmonkey](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey), 
Violentproxy is a monkey-in-the-middle proxy that aims at doing the same monkey things but in a different way, 
it has different restrictions and can possibly work together with Violentmonkey and uBlock Origin 
to create a better browsing experience. 

This should be possible in theory, it may or may not work out in the end. 

But hey, it ~~does~~ start, try it out: `node demo.js`. 

When it works again, it'll support SSL :smile:

Please open an issue if there is something you want me to know.
