# Violentproxy

Named after [Violentmonkey](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey), 
Violentproxy aims at doing the same monkey things but in a different way, 
it has different restrictions and can possibly work together with Violentmonkey to create a better Userscirpt experience. 

This project is not yet ready for use. 

It is a bare bone prototype, but it should start, try it out: `node demo.js`.
