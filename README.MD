# Violentproxy

Named after Violentmonkey, Violentproxy aims at doing the same monkey things but in a different way, 
it has different restrictions and can possibly work together with Violentmonkey to create a better Userscirpt experience. 

This project is not yet ready for use. 

It is a bare bone prototype, but it does start, try it out: `node ./Example.js`.
